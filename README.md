This project implements an image classification model using a modified ResNet50 architecture for a 3-class classification task. The model is trained on a dataset of medical images to classify them into three categories: COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia.

Some of the main features are:- 

Achieved an accuracy of 96%
used an dataset of 16k images
Modified ResNet50 architecture for 3-class classification
Data augmentation techniques for improved model generalization
Learning rate scheduling and early stopping for optimal training
Evaluation metrics including accuracy, loss, and classification report
Visualization of training/validation curves and confusion matrix
